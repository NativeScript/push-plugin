## Installation
In the Command prompt / Terminal navigate to your application root folder and run:

	tns plugin add nativescript-push-notifications


## Configuration
### Android

> See the [Android Configuration for using Firebase Cloud Messaging](#android-configuration-for-using-firebase-cloud-messaging) for information about how to add Firebase to your project.

- Edit the `package.json` file in the root of application, by changing the bundle identifier to match the Firebase's project package name. For example:
    ```
        "id": "org.nativescript.PushNotificationApp"
    ```

- Edit the `app/App_Resources/Android/app.gradle` file of your application, by changing the application ID to match the bundle identifier from the package.json. For example:
```
	android {
	  ...
  	  defaultConfig {
	    applicationId = "org.nativescript.PushNotificationApp"
	  }
	  ...
	}
```

- Go to the application folder and add the Android platform to the application

		tns platform add android

- Add the `google-settings.json` file with the FCM configuration to the `app/App_Resources/Android folder` in your app. If this file is not added, building the app for android will fail.

The plugin will default to version 11.4.2 of the `firebase-messaging` SDK.  If you need to change the version, you can add a project ext property `firebaseMessagingVersion` like so:

```Groovy
	// in the root level of /app/App_Resources/Android/app.gradle:
	project.ext {
	    firebaseMessagingVersion = "+" // OR the version you wish
	}
```

### iOS

- Ensure you have set up an App in your Apple Developer account, with Push Notifications enabled and configured. More on this in the Apple's [AddingCapabilities documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AddingCapabilities/AddingCapabilities.html) > `Configuring Push Notifications` section.

- Edit the package.json file in the root of application, by changing the bundle identifier to match the App ID. For example:
    ```
        "id": "org.nativescript.PushNotificationApp"
    ```

- Go to the application folder and add the iOS platform to the application
	```
        tns build ios
	```

- Go to (application folder)/platforms/ios and open the XCode project. Enable Push Notifications in the project Capabilities options. In case you don't have XCode,
go to (application folder)/platforms/ios/(application folder name) , find *.entitlements file and add to it `aps-environment` key and its value as shown below:
	```
    	<plist version="1.0">
		<dict>
			<key>aps-environment</key>
			<string>development</string>
		</dict>
		</plist>
    ```

## Usage 
### Android

Add code in your view model or component to subscribe and receive messages (don't forget to enter your Firebase Cloud Messaging **Sender ID** in the options of the register method):

*TypeScript*
```TypeScript
	import * as pushPlugin from "nativescript-push-notifications";
    pushPlugin.register({ senderID: '<ENTER_YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER>' }, (token: String) => {
		alert("Device registered. Access token: " + token);;
	}, function() { });

	pushPlugin.onMessageReceived((stringifiedData: String, fcmNotification: any) => {
        const notificationBody = fcmNotification && fcmNotification.getBody();
        alert("Message received!\n" + notificationBody + "\n" + stringifiedData);
    });
```

*Javascript*
```Javascript
	var pushPlugin = require("nativescript-push-notifications");
	pushPlugin.register({ senderID: '<ENTER_YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER>' }, function (data){
		alert("message", "" + data);
	}, function() { });

	pushPlugin.onMessageReceived(function callback(stringifiedData, fcmNotification) {
		var notificationBody = fcmNotification && fcmNotification.getBody();
        alert("Message received!\n" + notificationBody + "\n" + stringifiedData);
	});
```

- Run the app on the phone or emulator:

		tns run android

- The access token is written in the console and displayed on the device after the plugin sucessfully subscribes to receive notifications. When a notification comes, the message will be displayed in the notification area if the app is closed or handled directly in the onMessageReceived callback if the app is open.

### iOS

Add code in your view model or component to subscribe and receive messages:

*TypeScript*
```TypeScript
	import * as pushPlugin from "nativescript-push-notifications";
	const iosSettings = {
		badge: true,
		sound: true,
		alert: true,
		interactiveSettings: {
			actions: [{
				identifier: 'READ_IDENTIFIER',
				title: 'Read',
				activationMode: "foreground",
				destructive: false,
				authenticationRequired: true
			}, {
				identifier: 'CANCEL_IDENTIFIER',
				title: 'Cancel',
				activationMode: "foreground",
				destructive: true,
				authenticationRequired: true
			}],
			categories: [{
				identifier: 'READ_CATEGORY',
				actionsForDefaultContext: ['READ_IDENTIFIER', 'CANCEL_IDENTIFIER'],
				actionsForMinimalContext: ['READ_IDENTIFIER', 'CANCEL_IDENTIFIER']
			}]
		},
		notificationCallbackIOS: (message: any) => {
            alert("Message received!\n" + JSON.stringify(message));
        }
	};

	pushPlugin.register(iosSettings, (token: String) => {
		alert("Device registered. Access token: " + token);

		// Register the interactive settings
		if(iosSettings.interactiveSettings) {
			pushPlugin.registerUserNotificationSettings(() => {
				alert('Successfully registered for interactive push.');
			}, (err) => {
				alert('Error registering for interactive push: ' + JSON.stringify(err));
			});
		}
	}, (errorMessage: any) => {
		alert("Device NOT registered! " + JSON.stringify(errorMessage));
	});
```

*Javascript*
```Javascript
	var pushPlugin = require("nativescript-push-notifications");
	var iosSettings = {
		badge: true,
		sound: true,
		alert: true,
		interactiveSettings: {
			actions: [{
				identifier: 'READ_IDENTIFIER',
				title: 'Read',
				activationMode: "foreground",
				destructive: false,
				authenticationRequired: true
			}, {
				identifier: 'CANCEL_IDENTIFIER',
				title: 'Cancel',
				activationMode: "foreground",
				destructive: true,
				authenticationRequired: true
			}],
			categories: [{
				identifier: 'READ_CATEGORY',
				actionsForDefaultContext: ['READ_IDENTIFIER', 'CANCEL_IDENTIFIER'],
				actionsForMinimalContext: ['READ_IDENTIFIER', 'CANCEL_IDENTIFIER']
			}]
		},
		notificationCallbackIOS: function (data) {
			alert("message", "" + JSON.stringify(data));
		}
	};

	pushPlugin.register(iosSettings, function (data) {
		alert("Device registered. Access token" + data);

		// Register the interactive settings
			if(iosSettings.interactiveSettings) {
				pushPlugin.registerUserNotificationSettings(function() {
					alert('Successfully registered for interactive push.');
				}, function(err) {
					alert('Error registering for interactive push: ' + JSON.stringify(err));
				});
			}
	}, function() { });
```

- Run the app on the phone or simulator:

	    tns run ios

- [HINT] Install the [pusher app](https://github.com/noodlewerk/NWPusher) to send notifications to the device being debugged on. In the 'device push token' field paste the device access token generated in the {N} CLI / XCode debug console after launching the app.

## Troubleshooting

In case the application doesn't work as expected. Here are some things you can verify

### Android

- When the application is started using `tns run android` (i.e. in debug mode with livesync) some background notifications might not be received correctly. This happens because the app is not started in a normal way for debugging and the resume from background happens differently. To receive all notifications correctly, stop the app (swipe it away it from the recent apps list) and start it again by tapping the app icon on the device. 

- Thе `google-services` plugin is added automatically. If this fails, you can try adding it manually:
- - Navigate to the project `platforms/android/` folder and locate the application-level `build.gradle` file
- - Add the `google-services` plugin to the list of other dependencies in your app's `build.gradle` file
	```Groovy
	dependencies {
		// ...
		classpath "com.google.gms:google-services:3.0.0"
		// ...
	}
	```
- - Add the following line be at the bottom of your `build.gradle` file to enable the Gradle plugin
	```Groovy
	apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
	```

- Ensure that the AndroidManifest.xml located at platforms/android/build/... (**do not add it in your "App_Resources/Android/AndroidManifest.xml" file**) contains the following snippets for registering the GCM listener:

```XML
	<activity android:name="com.telerik.pushplugin.PushHandlerActivity"/>
	<receiver
		android:name="com.google.android.gms.gcm.GcmReceiver"
	    android:exported="true"
	    android:permission="com.google.android.c2dm.permission.SEND" >
	    <intent-filter>
	    	<action android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE" />
	        <category android:name="com.pushApp.gcm" />
	    </intent-filter>
	</receiver>
	<service
		android:name="com.telerik.pushplugin.PushPlugin"
	    android:exported="false" >
	    <intent-filter>
	    	<action android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE" />
	    </intent-filter>
	</service>
```

- Ensure that the AndroidManifest.xml located at platforms/android/build/... contains the following permissions for push notifications:

```xml
	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
	<uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.permission.RECEIVE" />
```

### iOS

- Error "Error registering: no valid 'aps-environment' entitlement string found for application" - this means that the certificates are not correctly set in the xcodeproject. Open the xcodeproject, fix them and you can even run the application from xcode to verify it's setup correctly. The bundle identifier in xcode should be the same as the "id" in the package.json file in the root of the project. Also make sure that "Push Notifications" is switched ON in the "Capabilities" page of the project settings.  


## Android Configuration for using Firebase Cloud Messaging

The `nativescript-push-notifications` module for Android relies on the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) SDK. In the steps below you will be guided to complete a few additional steps to prepare your Android app to receive push notifications from FCM.

1. Add the `google-services.json` file

	To use FCM, you need this file. It contains configurations and credentials for your Firebase project. To obtain this follow the instructions for adding Firebase to your project from the official [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup). Scroll down to the **Manually add Firebase** section.  

	Place the file in your app's `App_Resources/Android` folder

2. Obtain the FCM Server Key (optional)

	This key is required to be able to send programmatically push notifications to your app. You can obtain this key from your Firebase project.

### Receive and Handle Messages from FCM on Android

The plugin allows for handling **data**, **notification**, and messages that contain **both** payload keys which  for the purposes of this article are reffered to as **mixed**. More specifics on these messages are explained [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options#notifications_and_data_messages).

The plugin extends the `FirebaseMessagingService` and overrides its `onMessageReceived` callback. In your app you need to use the `onMessageReceived(stringifiedData, fcmNotification)` method of the NativeScript module.

The behavior of the `onMessageReceived` callback in the module follows the behavior of the FCM service.

#### Handling **Data** Messages

The `onMessageReceived` method of the plugin is called each time a `data` notification is received.

If the app is stopped or suspended, NO notification is constructed and placed in the tray. Tapping the app icon launches the app and invokes the `onMessageReceived` callback where you will receive the notification data.

If the app is active and in foreground, the `onMessageReceived` callback is invoked immediately with the notification data (fcmNotification).

#### Handling **Notification** Messages

If the app is active and in foreground, it invokes the `onMessageReceived` callback with two arguments (stringifiedData, fcmNotification).

If the app is in background, a notification is put in the tray. When tapped, it launches the app, but does not invoke the `onMessageReceived` callback.

#### Handling **Mixed** Messages

Mixed messages are messages that contain in their load both **data** and **notification** keys. When such message is received:

- The app is in foreground, the `onMessageReceived` callback is invoked with parameters (stringifiedData, fcmNotification)
- The app is in background, the `onMessageReceived` callback is not invoked. A notification is placed in the system tray. If the notification in the tray is tapped, the `data` part of the mixed message is available in the extras of the intent of the activity and are available in the respective [application event](https://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/application-lifecycle) of NativeScript.  

Example of handling the `data` part in the application *resume* event (e.g. the app was brought to the foreground from the notification):

*Javascript*
```Javascript
application.on(application.resumeEvent, function(args) {
    if (args.android) {
        var act = args.android;
        var intent = act.getIntent();
        var extras = intent.getExtras();
        if (extras) {
            // for (var key in extras) {
            //     console.log(key + ' -> ' + extras[key]);
            // }
            var msg = extras.get('someKey');
        }
    }
});
```

#### Parameters of the onMessageReceived Callback

Depending on the notification event and payload, the `onMessageReceived` callback is invoked with two arguments.

* `stringifiedData` - *String*. A stringified JSON representation of the `data` value in the notification payload.
* `fcmNotification` - `RemoteMessage.Notification`. A representation of the `RemoteMessage.Notification` class which can be accessed according to its public methods. This parameter is available in case the callback was called from a message with a `notification` key in the payload.

#### Setting Notification Icon and Color

The plugin automatically handles some keys in the `data` object like `message`, `title`, `color`, `smallIcon`, `largeIcon` and uses them to construct a notification entry in the tray. 

Custom default color and icon for **notification** messages can be set in the `AndroidManifest.xml` inside the `application` directive:

```XML
	<meta-data
		android:name="com.google.firebase.messaging.default_notification_icon"
		android:resource="@drawable/ic_stat_ic_notification" />
	<meta-data
		android:name="com.google.firebase.messaging.default_notification_color"
		android:resource="@color/colorAccent" />
```
